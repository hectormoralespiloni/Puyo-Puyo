5. CODE STURCTURE
	-The images folder contains all the png used in the game.
	-There are 4 classes: 
	* Sprite.java: 	this class manages the basic sprite stuff such as get and set
			its position, collision detection and drawing the sprite.
	* Puyo.java: 	this class inherits from sprite and adds functionality to move
			and rotate the puyos as well as handling collision detection.
	* Board.java:	this is the main threaded (implements runnable) canvas and it
			represents the game board (so to say) because it keeps track 
			of the position of the puyos which have reahced their final
			destination.
	* GameApp.java: this is the main entry point of the demo, it creates a new window	
			attach a board and starts the main thread of the game.
